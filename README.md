Spring Boot MVC and REST API Project

Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Spring Boot application that combines both MVC (Model-View-Controller) and REST API functionalities. The application interacts with a remote MySQL database and includes components such as entities, repositories, services, API controllers, and HTML views.<br />

Features<br />
Spring Boot: Utilizes the Spring Boot framework for easy setup and configuration.<br />
MVC Architecture: Implements the MVC design pattern for handling web requests and responses.<br />
RESTful API: Provides a set of RESTful endpoints for interacting with the application programmatically.<br />
MySQL Database: Connects to a remote MySQL database to store and retrieve data.<br />
Entity Classes: Defines entity classes to represent data objects in the application domain.<br />
Repository Layer: Utilizes Spring Data JPA repositories for database operations.<br />
Service Layer: Implements service classes to encapsulate business logic and interact with repositories.<br />
API Controllers: Defines controllers for handling REST API requests and responses.<br />
HTML Views: Provides HTML views for rendering user interfaces in web browsers.<br />
Installation<br />
Clone the repository to your local machine:<br />
bash<br />
Copy code<br />

git clone https://github.com/sarwaraminy/spring-boot-mvc.git<br />

Open the project in your preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment), such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.<br />
Configure the application properties (application.properties or application.yml) to specify the MySQL database connection details.<br />
Run the application:<br />
arduino<br />
Copy code<br />
./mvnw spring-boot:run<br />
or<br />
arduino<br />
Copy code<br />
mvn spring-boot:run<br />
Access the application using the provided URLs for MVC views and REST API endpoints.<br />
Usage<br />
MVC Views: Navigate to the HTML views using a web browser to interact with the application's user interface.<br />
REST API Endpoints: Send HTTP requests to the API endpoints using tools like cURL or Postman to interact with the application programmatically.<br />
